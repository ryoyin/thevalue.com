    'aboutUSContent' => '<h4>TheValue.com - a trilingual art news superhub which instantly provides market information of value to international readers.</h4>

    <p>Free and independent, TheValue.com arrives amid rising concerns over the monopoly of market information by auction houses and the lack of accurate, 
    reliable art news available in Chinese. Yet the global art market has remained inaccessible to many Chinese-speaking art enthusiasts and potential
    buyers; while the Chinese art market has still been much a mystery to interested parties overseas.</p>

    <p>TheValue.com enjoys close connections with experienced dealers, prominent collectors, and
    researchers and professionals from prestigious academic institutions around the globe. With our
    cross-cultural insider network, knowledge and perspective, we endeavor to bring transparency to the
    art markets. In addition, setting its base in Hong Kong—one of the world’s largest art markets,
    TheValue.com is privileged for a wide international reach.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, TheValue.com is a trilingual media platform, which provides media content in three
    languages: Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, and English. We strive to bridge the gap between
    Chinese and English reporting, linking the often-segregated Chinese art scene with the international
    art scene.</p>

    <p>By expertise and effort, since its release in 2016, TheValue.com has been breaking down every
    barrier for our readers to understand the art industry. It serves as a resourceful platform which will
    publicize art knowledge, nurture future experts in the field, and transform the art markets for the
    digital age.</p>',
